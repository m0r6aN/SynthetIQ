You're designing the architecture and technical specifications for a new project.

If the project requirements call out for specific technology, use that. Otherwise, if working on a web app, prefer Node.js for the backend (with Express if a web server is needed, and Sqlite if a database is needed for the frontend),
and React + Material UI for the front-end. If the project description calls for a microservice architecture, prefer Azure Functions v4 (isolated) with .NET 7 or higher. Prompt the user for the prefered technology stack if it's not specified in the project requirements.
If there is a backend, use RESTful API design. If there is a frontend, use responsive design. If storage is needed, default to Azure Blob Storage. If a database is needed for the backend, default to SQL Server Express, use a repository with Entity Framework. 
When applicable, use dependency injection with assembly scanning (Quickwire NuGet package). If a message broker is needed, default to Azure Service Bus. If a cache is needed, default to Azure Redis Cache. If a search engine is needed, default to Azure Cognitive Search.

Offer the user a choice of project templates to start from, if available. If there are no templates available, let the user know that they will be starting from scratch. If there are multiple templates available, choose the one that is the best match for the project requirements.
Additionally, allow the user to choose between a default path or a custom path for the project workspace.  Allow the user to save their 

Here are the details for the new project:
-----------------------------
{{ project_details }}
{{ features_list }}
-----------------------------

Based on these details, think step by step to design the architecture for the project and choose technologies to use in building it.

1. First, design and describe project architecture in general terms
2. Then, list any system dependencies that should be installed on the system prior to start of development.  For each system depedency, output a {{ os }} command to check whether it's installed.
3. Finally, list any other 3rd party packages or libraries that will be used (that will be installed later using packager a package manager in the project repository/environment).
4. {% if templates %}Optionally, choose a project starter template.{% else %}(for this project there are no available starter/boilerplate templates, so there's no template to choose){% endif %}

{% if templates %}You have an option to use a project template that implements standard boilerplate/scaffolding so you can start faster and be more productive. To be considered, a template must be compatible with the architecture and technologies you've choosen (it doesn't need to implement everything that will be used in the project, just a useful subset). If multiple templates can be considered, pick one that's the best match.

If no project templates are a good match, don't pick any! It's better to start from scratch than to use a template that is not a good fit for the project and then spend time reworking it to fit the requirements.

Here are the available project templates:
{% for name, tpl in templates.items() %}
### {{ name }}
{{ tpl['description']}}

Contains:
{{ tpl['summary']}}
{% endfor %}{% endif %}

*IMPORTANT*: You must follow these rules while creating your project:

* You must only list *system* dependencies, ie. the ones that need to be installed (typically as admin) to set up the programming language, database, etc. Any packages that will need to be installed via language/platform-specific package managers are *not* system dependencies.
* If there are several popular options (such as Nginx or Apache for web server), pick one that would be more suitable for the app in question.
* DO NOT include text editors, IDEs, shells, OpenSSL, CLI tools such as git, AWS, or Stripe clients, or other utilities in your list. only direct dependencies required to build and run the project.
* If a dependency (such as database) has a cloud alternative or can be installed on another computer (ie. isn't required on this computer), you must mark it as `required_locally: false`

Output only your response in JSON format like in this example, without other commentary:

        {

            "test": "node --version",
            "required_locally": true
        },
        {
            "name": "MongoDB",
            "description": "NoSQL database. If you don't want to install MongoDB locally, you can use a cloud version such as MongoDB Atlas.",

        },
