## Agent
An "Agent" could be considered a broader category that encompasses any AI-powered entity capable of performing tasks or making decisions autonomously. Agents might have specific areas of expertise or capabilities (like those listed in the AssistantCapability enum), but their primary characteristic is their ability to act independently based on inputs or predefined criteria. Agents could:

* Operate in the background, performing tasks without direct user interaction.
Handle more complex, autonomous decision-making processes.
Interact with or control other agents or assistants within the system.
Assistant
An "Assistant", on the other hand, could be viewed as a type of Agent specifically designed to interact with users, providing help based on user queries or tasks. Assistants would likely:

* Have a user-facing interface, potentially capable of understanding and generating natural language.
Perform tasks or fetch information directly in response to user requests.
Offer support or guidance within a more narrowly defined scope compared to Agents, which might operate across broader or more complex domains.

## Entity Models
* Given these distinctions, our entity models could reflect different attributes or relationships for Agents and Assistants:

## Agents: 
* Might have attributes related to their capabilities, operational parameters, status (active/inactive), and perhaps relationships to other agents or components they interact with.

## Assistants: 
* Would likely include attributes for managing user interaction, like preferred modes of communication (text, voice), language preferences, and personalization settings. Assistants might also have a reference to the specific Agent(s) they leverage to perform tasks.

## Implementation Consideration
* When designing our models, consider whether Agents and Assistants are distinct enough in our application to warrant separate models or if they could be effectively represented by a single model with attributes or flags to distinguish their roles. 
* For example: If the differences are primarily in how they interact with users, a single model with a role or type attribute could suffice.
  If they have fundamentally different behaviors, capabilities, or relationships within our system, defining separate models might provide clearer structure and flexibility.

# Examples
In this structure, Assistant inherits from Agent, allowing us to capture shared attributes in Agent while also specifying what makes an Assistant unique. This approach offers flexibility in 
how we implement and expand our AI functionalities.

```
public class Agent
{
    public Guid AgentId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public AgentType Type { get; set; } // Enum for Assistant, BackgroundAgent, etc.
    public List<Capability> Capabilities { get; set; }
    // Other general attributes...
}

public class Assistant : Agent
{
    public string Language { get; set; }
    public string CommunicationMode { get; set; } // Text, Voice, etc.
    // Specific attributes for user-facing assistants...
}


public enum AgentType
{
    Assistant,
    BackgroundAgent,
    Orchestrator
    // Other distinctions...
}

public class Capability
{
    public Guid CapabilityId { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    // Details about what the capability entails...
}

```

# Capabilities
## Definition: Capabilities are specific functions or areas of expertise that an agent or assistant can perform or handle. They are inherent properties of the agents/assistants, defining what tasks they are programmed or trained to do.
## Example: For an AI assistant, capabilities might include "Creative Writing", "Math Calculations", "Coding Assistance", or "Image Generation".
## Usage: When you're matching a project or user request to an agent or assistant, capabilities are used to ensure that the selected entity can perform the required task.

# Tags
## Definition: Tags are flexible, user-defined keywords or labels attached to agents, assistants, projects, or other entities. They serve as metadata to categorize, organize, and facilitate search and filtering.
## Example: An assistant might be tagged with "Friendly", "Technical", "Beginner-Friendly", or "Finance".
## Usage: Tags help users and the system to filter and find agents or assistants based on broader, sometimes subjective criteria that aren't strictly tied to their functional capabilities.

# Associated Prompts (Directives)
Integrating associated prompts or directives for each capability enriches our application by providing contextual or situational usage examples. This can enhance the user experience by 
offering guidance on how to effectively interact with agents or assistants.

## Definition: An associated prompt is a pre-defined instruction or question that effectively utilizes a specific capability of an agent or assistant.
Example: For a "Coding" capability, an associated prompt might be "Fix syntax errors in this code snippet" or "Translate this Python code to JavaScript".
Usage: These prompts can be presented to users as suggestions for interaction or used internally by the system to initiate specific tasks with agents or assistants based on user input or project needs.

## Implementing in the Entity Model
Considering these distinctions and integrations, our entity models could include relationships where agents or assistants have multiple capabilities, each capability could have multiple associated 
prompts, and any entity can have multiple tags.

```
public class Agent
{
    public Guid AgentId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection<Capability> Capabilities { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection<Tag> Tags { get; set; }
    // Additional properties...
}

public class Capability
{
    public Guid CapabilityId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public virtual ICollection<Prompt> AssociatedPrompts { get; set; }
    // Additional properties...
}

public class Prompt
{
    public Guid PromptId { get; set; }
    public string Directive { get; set; }
    // Additional properties...
}

public class Tag
{
    public Guid TagId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    // Additional properties...
}

```
